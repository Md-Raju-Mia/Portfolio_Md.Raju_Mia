            <p class="project-details__desc-para">
              In IIT we have done each of our SPL through analog process in previous time. There is no well furnished technological platform to understand the improvement of our own work. But in recent time there are numerous developed software for overlooking the improvement of our work, communicating with each others and sharing documents etc. But these resources are not free of cost. So we want to develop a project that aims for enriching our technological knowledge and leads IIT to forward.
